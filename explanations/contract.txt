When creating an NFT listing, you need to provide several key parameters to ensure the listing is properly set up and functions as intended. First, you must pass a capability that allows the storefront to withdraw the NFT when it is sold. This capability should be securely linked to your private storage path to prevent unauthorized access to your account's NFTs. Additionally, you need to specify the type of NFT being listed and its unique NFT ID. The listing also requires a payment vault type, which specifies the cryptocurrency or fungible token that will be used for the purchase.

A crucial part of the setup is defining the SaleCut structure, which determines how the payment is divided among recipients. For example, you might include a marketplace fee as one sale cut and allocate the remaining amount to the seller. Multiple sale cuts can be configured to accommodate complex payment arrangements. You will also need to provide the storefront ID where the listing will reside, as each account has a single storefront managing all its listings.

Once these parameters are provided, the listing is created and becomes part of your storefront. To make it accessible for potential buyers, link the listing's public capability to the ListingPublic interface, allowing others to call the purchase function and complete the transaction.
